# JSON-parser-bash

A zero-dependency JSON parser written fully in bash

## ⚠ WARNING ⚠

This parser was not made for public use and is not a great parser. It wasn't designed around the exact specifications of JSON and will fail under multiple circumstances when fed unexpected or invalid JSON data. It's just a simple script that was designed for a very particular use case within another of my projects. Use at your own risk.
